 Assignment Title:  Group One Function
 Assignment Description: This program inputs the 'a, b, and c'
            values of the quadratic formula
            from the user and uses them to calculate the formula's roots.

 We began the process on 4/19 meeting as a group over zoom discussing different
 ideas for a general algorithm. We discussed BFS, DFS and a graph scenario, and we
 ultimately ended up deciding to write pseudocode for the BFS and DFS to begin.
 
 We split the group-work as follows: TJ and Meka would work on the pseudocode and
 implementation of BFS and DFS, and Hannah, Aubrey and Madison would work with SDL
 Plotter and creating test cases and files. Each respective subgroup met throughout
 the week to work on their sections.
 
 We met again the following week and tested the BFS and DFS implementations on SDL.
 After discussing during the meeting, we decided to try implementing one more
 algorithm, the flood filled algorithm, in order to decrease our time.
 
 On 5/3, we discussed again and tested the flood filled algorithm; we achived a
 faster runtime and so we decided to use that in our main function.
